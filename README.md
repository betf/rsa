# RSA encryption on dataflow platform

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm invented by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
RSA is a relatively slow public key cryptosystem and can be accelerated by the Maxeler platform.
Implementation given for traditional CPU architecture is based on available literature.
Maxeler is used for acceleration of the RSA encryption based on Montgomery's method.
